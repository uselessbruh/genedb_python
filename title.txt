Hox Genes (e.g., HOXA1,): These genes are involved in the regulation of embryonic development and are found in animals, including humans. 

Hox Genes (e.g., HOXA2,): These genes are involved in the regulation of embryonic development and are found in animals, including humans.

BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1): This gene is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers when mutated. It plays a role in DNA repair.

TP53 (Tumor Protein p53): Also known as the "guardian of the genome," this gene regulates the cell cycle and prevents the formation of tumors.

INS (Insulin): The insulin gene codes for the hormone insulin, which is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels.

CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator): Mutations in this gene lead to cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting the respiratory and digestive systems.

MYH7 (Myosin Heavy Chain 7): This gene is involved in muscle contraction and is associated with various muscle-related disorders.

EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor): This gene codes for a receptor involved in cell growth and proliferation. Mutations can contribute to cancer development.

PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog): This gene acts as a tumor suppressor, helping to regulate cell growth and prevent the formation of tumors.

FOXP2 (Forkhead Box P2): Known as the "language gene," FOXP2 is associated with language development and speech.

ALDH2 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2): This gene plays a role in alcohol metabolism, and variations can affect an individual's tolerance to alcohol.
